<p>'It's very importamt to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you can ne doing it better.'</p>

  'Why this is important?'
  'It will be important to document, in some measure, how I move forward in order to understand what I've done and how I can improve. Also, if I am successfull in my long-term goals, keeping this record will serve the memories of future persons or intelligent agents who wish to understand something my cognitve past.'
