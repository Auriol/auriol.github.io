<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>'It's very importamt to have a feedback loop, where you're constantly thinking about what you've done and how you can be doing it better.' Elon Musk</p>
<p>In the immediate future, this page will serve to document my progress in self-studying computer science in order to satisfy the requirements for graduate study in the United States, and for personal development in pursuit of my goals along the artificial intelligence frontier.</p>
<p>'Why this is important?'
<p>'It will be important to document, in some measure, how I move forward in order to understand what I have done and how I can improve. Also, if I am successfull in my long-term goals, keeping this record will serve the memories of future persons or intelligent agents who wish to understand something of my cognitve past.
